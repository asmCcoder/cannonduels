Cannon Duels is a 1 or 2 players game for Amstrad CPC,
developed with CPCtelera and other tools for the 
#CPCRetroDev 2018.

Two Cannons are located at each side of the screen and 
can shoot at each other. At the centre of the screen
there is a group of bricks. Cannon Balls will destroy the 
first brick they encounter in their path or subtract a 
live from the opposite player if hitting the Cannon.
When hitting a Brick there is chance to get a Power Up. 
When a Cannon is hit by a Cannon Ball, it loses a live. 
Reaching 0 ends the game. A player gets an Extra Live 
every  time a collects 464 points.

Read the GameManual.pdf for more details on which Power Ups
are available and what they do.
